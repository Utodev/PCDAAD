PCDAAD 1.6 - "The Roebuck"
==========================

- Included a new type of EXTERNs


PCDAAD 1.5 - "A round green door"
=================================

- Fixed a bug with  convertible nouns, that were not working like in original interpreters.

PCDAAD 1.4 "Rochdale Balrog"
============================
- Fixed the way DAAD lists objects in LISTAT (continuous and normal mode)
- Fixed article/pronoun removal in english games

PCDAAD 1.3 "Colossal Cave"
==========================
- DOALL implementation has been updated to be more compatible by default. New -NDOALL parameter will now allow nested DOALLs if they are in different processes.
- Fixed bug in SYNONYM
- When looking for an object reference when provided with a noun and adjective, PCDAAD was allowing matches with objects whose noun was NO_WORD/255. Provided that that is theoretically correct (a match is a match), original interpreters were not allowing such matches, so the logic has been changed to ressemble that of the original ones.


PCDAAD 1.2 "Mislata"
====================
- Now PCDAAD does not crash with games without any conjugation in the vocabulary (i.e Adventuron exported ones)
